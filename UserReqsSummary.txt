LRG Parser- Team 1
Developers: Rebecca Haines, Laura Lopez-Pascua, Sara Rey and Ben Sanders 
User: Mike Cornell
Development start date: 13/11/14
Expected delivery date: 14/11/14

User requirements:
1. Use LRG files in xml format downloaded from http://www.lrg-sequence.org/
2. Produce a FASTA format file that contains just the sequences of the exons.
3. Have the option to output the sequences of the exons +/- a specified number of bases, eg for primer design.

Team 1 delivered output:
A program called lrgparser.py (written in python!) that takes an LRG file as an input and outputs a FASTA format file containing the exon sequences. 
The FASTA headers contain:
	gene name
	LRG file name
	exon number
	coordinates of the sequence (based on the LRG genomic sequence)

Delivery of user requirements:
1. Use LRG files in xml format
	Tests written to ensure files are in xml format before the program runs
2. FASTA format file produced
	Tests written to ensure program fails gracefully if there are errors.

User requirements still in progress:
3. Not done. This can be added with small modifications to the two of the functions within the program.
